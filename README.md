# Learn OOP

1. oop<object-oriented-programming> is a computer programming paradigm<prdom%model> that organizes software design around the data. and it concept of the "object" and "class"

## Key Concepts of OOP

## Class

it is a Blueprint for creating object.it defines a set of attributes and method.

### \* Method

are functions that objects can perform. They are defined inside a class that describe the behaviors of an object.

### \* Attributes

Attributes represent the state of an object. In other words, they are the characteristics that distinguish classes.

## Object

An instance f a class created with specifically defined data

## interface

# Concept Of OOP

## 1.Encapsulation

## 2.Abstraction

- Abstraction: hide some opreations detail from clients.and the child use them and it doesn't matter for them what happen in there and why exist this method.it is like interface but inerface 100% are Abstratins.
- no write to do this a scope for your abstrac class because it is assaginment for children.

```
    abstrac class parentClass {abstrac wrong() {return 3\*9}};
```
-Abstract method can not new.In most object-oriented programming languages that support abstract classes, you cannot directly instantiate an abstract class using the new keyword

## 3.Inheritance

## 4.Polymorphism
